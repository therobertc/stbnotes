(Question)

	Is it possible to change code in a smart contract? pg. 10 code that no one can 		change 

	How can you get the ethereum computer to run code faster? What takes so long to 	run the code? Why is it expensive?

Ethereum vs Ether

Ethereum is a network of computers and Ether is the fuel used to power the network.

	Ether is used to 
		pay transaction fees 
		launch a contract 
		call functions from a contract 

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 

	EVM is a program that the network of computers runs 
		the EVM runs smart contracts

Smart Contracts 

	smart contracts can be made in different languages 
		Serpent
		Viper 
		Solidity 
Gas 

	any transaction that invokes a smart contract method gets executed on every single 	ethereum node/client 

	ethereum can be thought of as a decentralized world computer, where you pay for 	computation using Ether

	the more complex the commands you wish to execute in a smart contract, the more 	gas you have to pay 

Ethereum Nodes

	an ethereum node is also called an ethereum client
	nodes/clients parse and verify the blockchain, its smart contracts and everything 	related.
